rtl_433_2db
===========
This is a customised version of rtl_433_2db made for Ambient Weather WS-2902B

This might work for other sations like it you might have to change the frequincy in the config file

Example Python script running rtl_433 as subprocess and sends output to mysql
It asumes a working rtl_433 in the same directory.
Needs:
      mysql connector
      Python 2.7 (tested, might work on others)
      


The code is based on my fork of rtl_433, so it needs customising to your devices.
